# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project uses machine learning to classify Iris flowers into three species — **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** — based on four key features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It is implemented in Python using **Scikit-learn** and demonstrates the complete ML workflow from data loading to prediction.
